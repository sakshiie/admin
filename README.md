# Admin Panel Dashboard

Admin Panel Dashboard is a web application built using React.js and Node.js, designed to provide administrators with tools for managing digital products, viewing sales data, and handling user authentication.

## Features

- **Product Management**: Admins can add, update, and delete digital products such as courses and event registrations.
- **Sales Dashboard**: Admins can view sales data for different time periods, including 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year, and lifetime sales.
- **Order Details**: Admins can access and view detailed information about each order placed within the system.
- **User Authentication**: Users can register, login, and logout to access admin features securely.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Admin Panel Dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

```
cd admin-panel-dashboard
npm install
cd server
npm install
```

3. Start the frontend and backend servers:

```
# In the root directory
npm start

# In the server directory
npm start
```

4. Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Backend Setup

The backend server is built using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database. Make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your system before running the server.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and provide the following environment variables:

```
PORT=3001
MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
```

Replace `<your-mongodb-uri>` with your MongoDB connection string and `<your-secret-key>` with a secret key for JWT authentication.

## Frontend Structure

The frontend is built using React.js and organized into components for better modularity and reusability. Here's a brief overview of the directory structure:

```
admin-panel-dashboard/
  public/
  src/
    components/
    pages/
    App.js
    index.js
  README.md
```

## Backend Structure

The backend server is structured using MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for better organization and separation of concerns. Here's a brief overview of the directory structure:

```
server/
  controllers/
  models/
  routes/
  server.js
  .env
